# Personal Development Constitution

A set of guiding principles for my personal projects. The goal is to build things that are well-crafted, maintainable, and fun to work on, both now and in the future.

## Core Principles

### 1. Think First, Code Second

Before writing any code, take a moment to define what I'm building and why. A simple list of features or user stories is enough to provide clarity and direction, preventing wasted effort.

### 2. Keep It Simple (YAGNI)

Build only what is needed right now. Resist the urge to add features for a hypothetical future. The simplest solution is usually the best starting point.

### 3. Test for Confidence

Write tests for critical logic. The goal isn't 100% coverage, but to create a safety net that allows for fearless refactoring and adding new features later. A good test suite proves the code works and makes future development faster and safer.

### 4. Build in Modules

Structure code in small, independent, and loosely-coupled pieces. Whether it's functions, classes, or services, each part should have a clear, single responsibility. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and reuse.

## Practical Guidelines

### Clean Code

- **Readable & Consistent:** Write code for a human to read. Use clear names and a consistent style, enforced by an automated formatter or linter.
- **Handle Errors:** Don't let errors fail silently. Handle them gracefully to create a more robust application.

### Smart Data Management

- **Avoid Raw SQL:** Use an ORM or a type-safe query builder to interact with the database.
- **Manage Schema Changes:** Use a migration tool to track and apply database schema changes. This prevents the database from getting out of sync with the code.

### Deployment Ready

- **Containerize It:** Package the application in a container (like Docker) from the beginning. This makes deployment predictable and consistent everywhere.
- **Externalize Configuration:** Keep configuration (like API keys, database URLs) out of the code. Use environment variables or `.env` files.

### Practical Security

- **Validate All Input:** Never trust any data coming from outside the application.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Use a tool to scan for and update vulnerable third-party packages.
- **Simplify Local Auth:** For projects with authentication, use a simple, local-only mechanism during development to simulate users. This makes testing authorization rules easy without the hassle of a full login flow.
